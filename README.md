##### 1. Appstore API Key
This step help obtaining `APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID`, `APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID` and `APPSTORE_API_PRIVATE_KEY`  
To generate keys, you must have an Admin account in App Store Connect. You may generate multiple API keys with any roles you choose for purpose of this project create API key with App Manager level role.

To generate an API key to use with the App Store Connect API, log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).
```
  i. Select Users and Access, and then select the API Keys tab.

  ii. Click Generate API Key or the Add (+) button.

  iii. Enter a name for the key. The name is for your reference only and is not part of the key itself.

  iv. Under Access, select the role for the key. (For CI/CD App Manager level role is sufficient)

  v. Click Generate.
```
The new key's name, key ID, a download link, and other information appears on the page.

##### Download and Store the Private Key
Once you've generated your API key, you are given the opportunity to download the private half of the key. The private key is available for download a single time.

The download link appears only if the private key has not yet been downloaded. Apple does not keep a copy of the private key.
Store your private key in a safe place.

***Important***

***Keep your API keys secure and private. You should never share your keys, store keys in a code repository, or include keys in client-side code.***

***If the key becomes lost or compromised, remember to revoke it immediately. See Revoking API Keys for more information.***
